# SQL_Challenges
This repository contains SQL challenges I completed while taking a course on Udemy. The challenges cover various SQL concepts like joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions. Each folder includes a README.md with context and an SQL file with my solutions. Explore, suggest improvements, or discuss alternative approaches!
