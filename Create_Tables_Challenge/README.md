<h1>CREATE TABLES CHALLENGE</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
In this exercise, I created a table named parks1 to store information about different parks, including their ID, name, and entry fee. I then inserted records for three parks, ensuring that the data was accurately added to the table. This challenge helped reinforce my understanding of table creation and data insertion in SQL.
