<h1>JOIN CHALLENGES</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>During my SQL course, I focused on mastering different types of JOINsâ€”a crucial aspect of relational database querying. The challenges I completed involved using various JOIN operations to retrieve and manipulate data across multiple tables. These exercises helped me understand how to combine data from different sources, filter results effectively, and solve complex queries that require an in-depth understanding of database relationships.
