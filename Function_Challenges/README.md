<h1>FUNCTION CHALLENGES</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In these challenges, I worked on various SQL operations, including string manipulation, date functions, and aggregate calculations. The exercises included concatenating employee names, extracting parts of scientific names, calculating employee ages, determining estimated shipping dates, and analyzing average shipping times by company. These tasks helped strengthen my ability to work with text and date data types in SQL, as well as perform complex calculations and data grouping.</p>
